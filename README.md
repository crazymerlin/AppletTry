# AppletTry
A simple HelloWorld applet
A simple HelloWorld applet that is embedded in a JSP page.
This project is my second step in Web-programming.
It includes two modules: applet and web-application (actually - JSP page).
Also my work consisted of writing an HelloWorld applet class, embedding it in a JSP page, configurating artifacts, and deploying on the server.
